## 1️⃣ Prerequisites

| Tool | Minimum version | Why it's needed |
|------|------------------|----------------|
| **JDK** | **21** (JetBrains Runtime – JBR – recommended) | Gradle build, Kotlin compilation, KSP code generation, and Desktop CSD features which rely on JBR. |
| **Android Studio** | Arctic Fox (2020.3.1) or newer | Android target development and UI preview. |
| **Xcode** | 15.0 or newer (macOS only) | iOS target compilation and simulator runs. |
| **Gradle** | **9.2.1** (wrapper version) | Newest features and faster builds. |
| **Git** | Any recent version | Version control and contribution workflow. |

> **Note** – The project is configured for JDK 21 with the JetBrains Runtime (JBR). We have not tested the application with older JDK versions, so compatibility cannot be guaranteed.

---

## 2️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub first (optional but recommended)
git clone https://github.com/<your‑username>/Foliary.git
cd Foliary
```

The repository uses a **Git‑Town** workflow (`git-town.toml`). If you are unfamiliar with it, you can still use regular Git commands; just avoid rebasing the `main` branch directly.

## 3️⃣ Project Structure Overview

```
Foliary/                     # Root of the repo
├─ android/                 # Android‑specific source set & Gradle module
├─ desktop/                 # Desktop (JVM) entry‑point (Main.kt)
├─ ios/                     # Xcode project consuming the shared framework
├─ foliary/                 # Multiplatform shared module
│   ├─ src/commonMain/kotlin   # Business logic, UI (Compose), Koin modules
│   ├─ src/androidMain/kotlin  # Android‑specific implementations
│   ├─ src/iosMain/kotlin      # iOS‑specific implementations
│   └─ src/jvmMain/kotlin      # Desktop‑specific implementations
├─ .run/                    # IDE run configurations for Desktop (hot‑reload) – auto‑appears in JetBrains IDE run menu
├─ build.gradle.kts          # Root Gradle script (plugins, repositories)
├─ settings.gradle.kts       # Module inclusion
└─ gradle/                  # Wrapper & additional scripts
```

## 4️⃣ Building & Running

### General commands (run from the repository root)

```bash
# Clean the project
./gradlew clean

# Assemble all targets (Android APK, iOS framework, Desktop JAR)
./gradlew assemble
```

### Desktop (JVM)

The project ships pre‑configured run configurations located in the `.run/` folder. They provide hot‑reload support and appear automatically in the **Run** menu of JetBrains IDEs.

```bash
# You can also launch the app directly via Gradle
./gradlew :desktop:run
```

### Android

1. Open the project in **Android Studio** (`File > Open > foliary/android`).
2. Sync Gradle (the wrapper will download Gradle 9.2.1 automatically).
3. Build & run on a device or emulator:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :android:assembleDebug   # Generates an APK in android/build/outputs/apk/debug
   ```
   Or click the **Run** button in Android Studio.

### iOS

The iOS integration is fully automated – you **do not** need to invoke any Gradle tasks. Simply open the Xcode workspace at `ios/Foliary.xcworkspace` and press **Run**. Xcode will build the shared `FoliaryShared` framework and launch the app on the selected simulator or device.

---

## 5️⃣ Testing

The project contains unit tests for the shared module and platform‑specific UI tests (Compose Multiplatform testing works on the JVM, no Android emulator required).

```bash
# Run only the shared JVM tests
./gradlew :foliary:jvmTest

# Android unit tests (no instrumentation tests)
./gradlew :foliary:testDebugUnitTest

# iOS simulator tests (Apple Silicon only)
./gradlew :foliary:iosSimulatorArm64Test
```

Test reports are generated under `build/reports/tests/` for each module.

## 6️⃣ Code Style & Formatting

* **Kotlin** – The project follows the official Kotlin coding conventions.
  * **Detekt** – static analysis (run automatically via a **pre‑push** git hook).
  * **ktlint** – code formatting (also enforced by the pre‑push hook).
* **Compose** – UI code should follow the Compose style guide (use `Modifier` chaining, avoid deeply nested layouts).
* **XML resources** (Android) – lint is enforced via the Android Gradle plugin.

### Pre‑push Git Hook

A pre‑push hook is provided in the repository that runs `./gradlew detekt` before any push to a remote. This ensures that static analysis always passes locally, and the CI will have a clean check.

---

## 7️⃣ Dependency Management

All dependencies are defined in the version catalog `gradle/libs.versions.toml`. When adding a new library:
1. **Only add a dependency if it is strictly necessary** – avoid unnecessary external libraries.
2. Add the version entry under `[versions]`.
3. Reference it in the appropriate section (`[libraries]`).
4. Use the alias in Gradle, e.g., `implementation(libs.koin.core)`.

Never hard‑code version numbers in `build.gradle.kts`; always go through the catalog to keep the project reproducible across platforms.

---

## 8️⃣ Issue Reporting & Branch Naming

* **Issues** – We will provide issue and pull‑request templates soon, so just open a clear description of the problem or feature.
* **Branch naming** – Use the pattern:
  ```
  <issue-number>-<short-description>
  ```
  For example, `123-fix-padding` for a change that resolves issue #123. This makes it easy to track which PR addresses which issue.

All branches should be based on the latest `main`.

---

## 9️⃣ Pull‑Request Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository (if you haven't already).
2. **Create a branch** from `main` using the naming convention above.
3. **Make your changes** – keep commits atomic and descriptive.
4. **Run the full test suite** locally (`./gradlew allTests`).
5. **Push** the branch to your fork. The pre‑push hook will automatically run Detekt and ktlint; you do not need to run them manually.
6. Open a **Pull Request** against `MessiasLima/Foliary:main`.
   * Provide a concise title.
   * Reference the related issue (`Fixes #123`).
   * Summarize what was changed and why.
7. The CI will automatically:
   * Build all platforms.
   * Run unit and UI tests.
   * Verify that the code passes static analysis (already checked by the pre‑push hook).
8. Address any review comments. When approved, a maintainer will merge the PR using **squash‑merge**.

---

## 🔁 Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions)

The workflow defined at `.github/workflows/pull-request.yml` runs on every PR and performs the following steps:
* **Gradle build** for all targets.
* **Unit & UI tests** (Compose Multiplatform UI tests run on the JVM; no Android instrumented tests are required).
* **Static analysis** – Detekt and ktlint checks (redundant with the pre‑push hook but kept for CI safety).

The workflow no longer checks for dependency updates.
